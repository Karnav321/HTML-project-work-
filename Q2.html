    <h2>Jaguars are powerful, solitary big cats, the largest in the Americas and third-largest globally, known for their distinctive rosette spots and strong jaws that can bite through skulls and shells. They are strong swimmers and climbers, occupying rainforests and wetlands, and are opportunistic carnivores with a diet that includes deer, fish, and even caiman. Though once more widespread, jaguars are now primarily found in Central and South America, classified as "near threatened" due to habitat loss and other threats. </h2><br/>
